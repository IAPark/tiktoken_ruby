# tiktoken_ruby

[Tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) is BPE tokenizer from OpenAI used with their GPT models.
This is a wrapper around it aimed primarily at enabling accurate counts of GPT model tokens used.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add tiktoken_ruby

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install tiktoken_ruby

## Usage
Usage should be very similar to the python library. Here's a simple example

Encode and decode text
```ruby
require 'tiktoken_ruby'

enc = Tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
enc.decode(enc.encode("hello world")) #=> "hello world"
```

Encoders can also be retrieved by model name
```ruby
require 'tiktoken_ruby'

enc = Tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")
enc.encode("hello world").length #=> 2
```

## RBS support

Tiktoken comes with Ruby type signatures (RBS).

To use them with Steep, add `library "tiktoken_ruby"` to your `Steepfile`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
